# See http://help.github.com/ignore-files/ for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore all the links and pictures and stuff I put in research folder
/research

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/log/*.log
/tmp
