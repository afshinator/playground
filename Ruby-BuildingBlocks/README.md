# Ruby Building Blocks

My implementation of Odin Projects Ruby excerises.

*	Project 1: Caesar Cipher
* 	Project 2: Stock Picker
*	Project 3: Substrings

In the tradition of [TestFirst](http://testfirst.org/learn_ruby), exercises include rspec test files.  Run the rake file to run tests.

Or if you dont want to run tests, load in the rb file manually and invoke the functions.
